## INTRODUCTION
In every day life of the modern era, companies(technical and non-technical) and start-ups release products of different categories for consumer's benefits. Selection of one or more of these products are accompanied by the experience and feedbacks of the earlier users. Customer's who have already used products justify their experience by putting up a review on the internet and also leave a ratings after its usage. Ratings can be easily sorted and judged as a result of its ordinality, 1- very poor, 3- neutral and 5- very good on a 1-5 scale. But Reviews comes with sentences, positive or negative texts, which will requires thorough reading and understanding for the message to be conveyed to the developer of the products. 
With the advent of a branch of Artificiial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing (NLP), its tools, algorithms and its implemention has helped companies to lessen and ease the task of analyzing reviews to make meaningful judgement, corrections and updates to problem faced with their products.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT
Customer feedbacks of products are necessary to help improve the business and make decision. Companies get a vast amount of feedbacks from their users. It is very tasky and tedious work to go through each reviews. Therefore, it will be paramount for company to build feedback management systems incorporated with models to help classify individual user's reviews, ratings and also determine the overall ratings of their product. This will ensure that company get complete idea on the feedback provided by their customers and put in necessary measures to attend to it whenever reviews comes in. This makes customer's loyality increases, make them propagate the product and services, and also increase the profit, brand, value and fame of the company.

## SENTIMENT ANALYSIS
Sentiment analysis (or opinion mining) is a Natural Language Processing (NLP) technique used to determine whether a message or text is positive, negative or neutral. Sentiment analysis is a textual classification tool that help businesses monitor brand and product sentiment in customer feedback, and understand customer feelings, thoughts more openly than before. With this technology, companies can analyze feedbacks from responses, sentiments, surveys, tweets and easily attend to their customer to better tailor their products and services to meet their needs.

## DATASETS
The datasets used for this project is derived from reviews scraped from the Google App Playstore of the top 8 FinTech Companies in Africa.
Since the reviews in the internet are imbalanced, the reviews data are scraped with rating 3 -Neutral making twice as much as the other ratings. Also, to get the important ratings and reviews the Sort order Most Relevant and NEWEST were chosen.

The datasets consists of 20,000+ reviews balanced with ratings.


## PROJECT OBJECTIVES
1. Preprocess and clean reviews to prepare for visualization and model
2. Generate visualization and make a story from the processed reviews
3. Extract features from the cleaned reviews
4. Build a Sentiment Analysis Model
